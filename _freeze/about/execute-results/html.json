The goal is to develop a machine learning pipeline that can detect abnormal daily price or volume movements using technical analysis (TA) indicators.\n\nWe define anomalies as:\n\n- **Price spikes or crashes**: Daily returns exceeding $\\pm$5%.\n\n- **Volume surges**: Daily trading volume exceeding 2× the 30-day moving average.\n\nBy engineering over 30 TA-based features (momentum, trend, volume, and volatility), we aim to identify leading patterns that consistently precede such events.\n\n---\n\n# Approach Summary\n\n- **Data Collection**: Daily OHLCV data for *AtHub* over a multi-year period.\n- **Feature Engineering**: Over 30 technical indicators computed using rolling windows.\n- **Modeling**: Supervised learning for anomaly classification (binary targets).\n- **Evaluation**: Time-aware cross-validation to preserve chronological integrity.\n- **Interpretation**: SHAP analysis to understand key feature interactions.\n\n---\n\n# Contributors\n\nThis project was developed by\n\n- **Annabelle Zhu**, Project Author\n- **Dr. Greg Chism**, Professor of INFO 523.\n\n",
