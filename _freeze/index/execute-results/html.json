We define volatility anomalies as daily returns exceeding ±5% or volume surges exceeding twice the 30-day rolling average. Drawing on over 30 engineered TA indicators spanning momentum, trend, volume, and volatility categories, we construct a supervised learning pipeline to forecast next-day anomalies. The model is evaluated using time-aware cross-validation and interpreted through SHAP analysis to reveal leading patterns and feature contributions. Results suggest that certain TA combinations (e.g., high RSI with declining OBV) consistently precede large movements, demonstrating the potential of interpretable, data-driven tools for anomaly detection in high-volatility equities.\n\n# Introduction\n\nPredicting sudden shifts in equity price or trading volume is a long-standing challenge in financial forecasting, particularly for high-volatility stocks sensitive to external shocks. This project centers on AtHub (603881.SH), a stock known for its erratic short-term behavior and policy-driven sensitivity, to assess whether machine learning models can detect early signs of abnormal market activity. Unlike traditional models that aim to forecast precise price levels, our approach reframes the task as a binary classification problem focused on identifying rare but impactful events. We rely exclusively on market-based features—technical indicators derived from historical prices and volumes—to build a predictive framework that aligns with real-world constraints where external signals (e.g., news sentiment, fundamentals) may be unavailable or delayed. By integrating explainable AI methods into the model workflow, this project also emphasizes transparency and trustworthiness in financial ML applications.\n\n## Feature Engineering Details\n\n### Technical Indicators Generated\n\nWe engineer 30+ TA features across 4 key dimensions:\n\n#### 1. **Momentum Indicators**\n\n-   **RSI (14-day)**: Identifies overbought (\\>70) and oversold (\\<30) conditions\n-   **MACD (12,26,9)**: Captures trend direction and momentum shifts\n-   **Williams %R (14-day)**: Measures closing prices relative to recent highs/lows\n\n### 2. **Volume Indicators**\n\n-   **OBV (On-Balance Volume)**: Cumulative volume flow predictor\n-   **Volume MFI (14-day)**: Money Flow Index combining price/volume\n-   **VPT (Volume Price Trend)**: Similar to OBV but more sensitive\n\n### 3. **Volatility Indicators**\n\n-   **ATR (14-day)**: Average True Range for volatility measurement\n-   **Bollinger Band Width**: Normalized volatility metric\n-   **Ulcer Index**: Drawdown-based risk measure\n\n### 4. **Trend Indicators**\n\n-   **ADX (14-day)**: Trend strength quantifier\n-   **Aroon Oscillator**: Identifies trend changes\n-   **CCI (20-day)**: Cyclical trend detector\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-feature-correlation .cell message='false' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Correlation Heatmap of Selected Features](index_files/figure-html/feature-correlation-output-1.png){#feature-correlation}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Model Development Approach\n\n## Data Splitting Strategy\n\nGiven the time-series nature of stock data, we implement: - **Chronological split**: First 80% for training, last 20% for testing - **Walk-forward validation**: Expanding window cross-validation\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n\nWe prioritize: - **Recall**: Minimizing false negatives (missed anomalies) - **F1-score**: Balancing precision/recall - **Matthews Correlation Coefficient**: Robust to class imbalance\n\n## Baseline Models\n\n| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **XGBoost** | Handles nonlinear relationships | Requires careful tuning |\n| **LightGBM** | Efficient with large features | Sensitive to outliers |\n| **Logistic Regression** | Interpretable coefficients | Limited nonlinear capacity |\n\n# Expected Outcomes\n\n1.  **Threshold Analysis Results**:\n    -   Precision-recall curves for ±3%/±5%/±7% thresholds\n    -   Optimal threshold selection based on trading costs\n2.  **Top Predictive Features**:\n    -   SHAP summary plot of top 10 influential indicators\n    -   Temporal importance patterns (e.g., volume leads price)\n3.  **Practical Trading Rules**:\n    -   Actionable signals like:\\\n        *\"When RSI \\> 70 AND OBV \\< 30-day average → 67% probability of next-day drop \\>5%\"*\n4.  **Interactive Dashboard**:\n    -   Dynamic visualization of anomaly predictions\n    -   Threshold adjustment interface\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n",
