# üìù Proposal

This project proposes the development of an interpretable machine learning model for forecasting short-term volatility anomalies in the Chinese equity market, using AtHub (603881.SH) as a case study. AtHub is a data center infrastructure provider whose stock demonstrates unusually high daily volatility and frequent sensitivity to external events such as government policy announcements [@lin2024datahub]. Rather than predicting stock prices directly‚Äîa notoriously noisy and non-stationary target‚Äîthis study focuses on detecting next-day abnormal price or volume events, defined as daily returns exceeding ¬±5% or volume spikes greater than 2√ó the rolling average.

We aim to construct a binary classifier that leverages over 30 technical analysis (TA) indicators across momentum, volume, trend, and volatility domains. These features are engineered using the Tushare API and the `tsta` library, covering 218 trading days of AtHub data. The project will incorporate time-aware cross-validation to avoid look-ahead bias and SHAP analysis for post-hoc interpretability. Ensemble models like LightGBM and XGBoost will serve as the backbone of the predictive framework, selected for their robustness in handling noisy, nonlinear tabular data. The final outcome will include an interactive visualization of feature contributions, along with a brief report and presentation.

This proposal reflects a practical and scalable approach to market anomaly detection, especially relevant for traders and risk managers seeking data-driven early warning systems.

# üéØ High-Level Goal

To develop a machine learning classifier that predicts next-day abnormal volatility events in AtHub (603881.SH) stock using technical analysis (TA) indicators, with anomalies defined as price movements exceeding ¬±5% or volume surges \>2√ó the 30-day average.

## Dataset Summary

The dataset is sourced via the **Tushare API** and engineered using Python‚Äôs `tsta` technical indicator library. It includes:

-   **375 daily records** of AtHub stock trading from the past \~18 months

-   **31 columns**, including:

    -   **Price data**: `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `pct_chg`
    -   **Volume metrics**: `vol`, `amount`, `volume_obv`, `volume_cmf`, `volume_vpt`, `volume_vwap`, `volume_mfi`
    -   **Volatility indicators**: `volatility_bbw`, `volatility_atr`, `volatility_ui`
    -   **Trend & momentum indicators**: `trend_macd`, `trend_adx`, `momentum_rsi`, `momentum_wr`, `momentum_roc`, `trend_aroon_up`, etc.

This feature-rich time series provides a robust foundation for testing anomaly detection models under realistic, noisy conditions.

## Target `Anomalies`

```{python}
#| label: target-visualization
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Anomaly Labels (Target Variable)"
#| fig-subcap: ["Anomaly Class Distribution", "Daily Returns Histogram"]

# Calculate anomaly days
df['anomaly'] = ((df['pct_chg'].abs() >= 5) | 
                (df['vol'] > 2 * df['vol'].rolling(30).mean())).astype(int)

# Plot
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))
df['anomaly'].value_counts().plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', 
                                 colors=['#66b3ff','#ff9999'], ax=ax1)
ax1.set_title('Anomaly Class Distribution')

df['pct_chg'].plot(kind='hist', bins=50, color='#66b3ff', ax=ax2)
ax2.axvline(x=5, color='red', linestyle='--')
ax2.axvline(x=-5, color='red', linestyle='--')
ax2.set_title('Daily Returns Distribution (¬±5% Threshold)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Feature Construction Strategy

To effectively model price and volume anomalies, we engineered over 30 technical indicators across four core dimensions widely adopted in quantitative trading:

-   **Momentum** (e.g., RSI, MACD, Williams %R): capture price velocity and potential reversals.
-   **Volume-based** (e.g., OBV, MFI, VPT): track accumulation/distribution behavior.
-   **Volatility** (e.g., ATR, Bollinger Band Width, Ulcer Index): quantify market turbulence.
-   **Trend strength** (e.g., ADX, Aroon, CCI): detect the emergence or weakening of price trends.

These indicators were computed using the `tsta` Python library and merged with daily OHLCV data. We conducted correlation analysis to filter redundant signals and retain complementary ones, as illustrated in the figure below.

```{python}
#| label: feature-target-corr
#| fig-cap: "Correlation Between Features and Target (Anomaly)"

from scipy.stats import pointbiserialr

selected_features = ['momentum_rsi', 'volume_obv', 'volatility_atr', 
                     'trend_macd_diff', 'volume_vpt', 'trend_adx']

corr_with_target = {}
for col in selected_features:
    corr, _ = pointbiserialr(df['anomaly'], df[col])
    corr_with_target[col] = corr

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.barplot(x=list(corr_with_target.values()), y=list(corr_with_target.keys()), palette='coolwarm')
plt.xlabel('Point Biserial Correlation with Target (Anomaly)')
plt.title('Feature-Target Correlation')
plt.grid(axis='x', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

This engineered feature space provides interpretable signals that are sensitive to both directional shifts and liquidity changes‚Äîtwo major components in anomaly formation.

## Model Development Approach

### Data Splitting Strategy

Given the time-series nature of stock data, we implement:

-   **Chronological split**: First 80% for training, last 20% for testing

-   **Walk-forward validation**: Expanding window cross-validation

### Evaluation Metrics

We prioritize: - **Recall**: Minimizing false negatives (missed anomalies)

-   **F1-score**: Balancing precision/recall

-   **Matthews Correlation Coefficient**: Robust to class imbalance

### Baseline Models

| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **XGBoost** | Handles nonlinear relationships | Requires careful tuning |
| **LightGBM** | Efficient with large features | Sensitive to outliers |
| **Logistic Regression** | Interpretable coefficients | Limited nonlinear capacity |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# üìç Motivation & Goals

**Why AtHub (603881.SH)?** AtHub is a leading Chinese data center infrastructure provider whose stock exhibits unusually high short-term volatility, making it a strong candidate for anomaly-based forecasting. Over the past six months, its daily return volatility ($\sigma \approx$ 35%) has far exceeded the industry average ($\approx$ 22%). Moreover, its price reacts sharply to regulatory announcements and policy shifts, reflecting its sensitivity to macro-level and sector-specific events.

This project aims to detect and forecast short-term abnormal volatility events in AtHub‚Äôs stock using supervised machine learning. Instead of heuristic rules, we define volatility anomalies using **quantifiable thresholds**: price changes beyond ¬±5% or trading volumes exceeding 2$\times$ the 30-day average. Our key goals are:

-   **Build an interpretable prediction model** using over 30 engineered technical indicators (e.g., MACD, RSI, OBV, ATR).
-   **Evaluate event-driven prediction performance** using time-series-aware cross-validation and dynamic thresholding strategies.
-   **Provide real-world utility** in the form of a probabilistic alert system for volatility-prone trading days.

SHAP analysis is integrated to uncover feature interactions that precede volatility (e.g., ‚Äúhigh RSI + declining OBV‚Äù may precede reversals), offering not just predictive power but also interpretability.
