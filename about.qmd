# Project Overview

This project explores the predictive modeling of short-term volatility anomalies in the Chinese equity market, with a specific focus on the stock *AtHub (603881.SH)*—a data center infrastructure company. The goal is to develop a machine learning pipeline that can detect abnormal daily price or volume movements using technical analysis (TA) indicators.

We define anomalies as:

- **Price spikes or crashes**: Daily returns exceeding $\pm$ 5%.

- **Volume surges**: Daily trading volume exceeding 2× the 30-day moving average.

By engineering over 30 TA-based features (momentum, trend, volume, and volatility), we aim to identify leading patterns that consistently precede such events.

# Approach Summary

- **Data Collection**: Daily OHLCV data for *AtHub* over a multi-year period.
- **Feature Engineering**: Over 30 technical indicators computed using rolling windows.
- **Modeling**: Supervised learning for anomaly classification (binary targets).
- **Evaluation**: Time-aware cross-validation to preserve chronological integrity.
- **Interpretation**: SHAP analysis to understand key feature interactions.
