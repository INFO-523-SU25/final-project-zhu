    "text": "This project proposes the development of an interpretable machine learning model for forecasting short-term volatility anomalies in the Chinese equity market, using AtHub (603881.SH) as a case study. AtHub is a data center infrastructure provider whose stock demonstrates unusually high daily volatility and frequent sensitivity to external events such as government policy announcements (Lin et al. 2024). Rather than predicting stock prices directly—a notoriously noisy and non-stationary target—this study focuses on detecting next-day abnormal price or volume events, defined as daily returns exceeding ±5% or volume spikes greater than 2× the rolling average.\nWe aim to construct a binary classifier that leverages over 30 technical analysis (TA) indicators across momentum, volume, trend, and volatility domains. These features are engineered using the Tushare API and the tsta library, covering 218 trading days of AtHub data. The project will incorporate time-aware cross-validation to avoid look-ahead bias and SHAP analysis for post-hoc interpretability. Ensemble models like LightGBM and XGBoost will serve as the backbone of the predictive framework, selected for their robustness in handling noisy, nonlinear tabular data. The final outcome will include an interactive visualization of feature contributions, along with a brief report and presentation.\nThis proposal reflects a practical and scalable approach to market anomaly detection, especially relevant for traders and risk managers seeking data-driven early warning systems."

    "text": "This project investigates whether abnormal price and volume fluctuations in AtHub (603881.SH)—a Chinese data center infrastructure firm—can be predicted using technical analysis (TA) features. We define volatility anomalies as daily returns exceeding ±5% or volume surges exceeding twice the 30-day rolling average. Drawing on over 30 engineered TA indicators spanning momentum, trend, volume, and volatility categories, we construct a supervised learning pipeline to forecast next-day anomalies. The model is evaluated using time-aware cross-validation and interpreted through SHAP analysis to reveal leading patterns and feature contributions. Results suggest that certain TA combinations (e.g., high RSI with declining OBV) consistently precede large movements, demonstrating the potential of interpretable, data-driven tools for anomaly detection in high-volatility equities."

The tuning process explored various combinations of regularization strength (C), penalty types (l1, l2), and solvers compatible with L1 regularization (liblinear, saga).\nBy optimizing for recall, we aimed to prioritize the detection of abnormal events (true positives), even at the potential cost of increased false positives.\nThe best-performing configuration is as follows:\n\nC: 0.001\nPenalty: L1\nSolver: liblinear\nCross-validated Recall: 0.9077\n\nThis configuration reflects a strong preference for sparsity and regularization, which is suitable for handling high-dimensional or potentially collinear feature spaces.

The goal is to develop a machine learning pipeline that can detect abnormal daily price or volume movements using technical analysis (TA) indicators.\nWe define anomalies as:\n\nPrice spikes or crashes: Daily returns exceeding $$5%.\nVolume surges: Daily trading volume exceeding 2× the 30-day moving average.\n\nBy engineering over 30 TA-based features (momentum, trend, volume, and volatility), we aim to identify leading patterns that consistently precede such events.\n\n\n\nApproach Summary\n\nData Collection: Daily OHLCV data for AtHub over a multi-year period.\nFeature Engineering: Over 30 technical indicators computed using rolling windows.\nModeling: Supervised learning for anomaly classification (binary targets).\nEvaluation: Time-aware cross-validation to preserve chronological integrity.\nInterpretation: SHAP analysis to understand key feature interactions.\n\n\n\n\nContributors\nThis project was developed by\n\nAnnabelle Zhu, Project Author\nDr. Greg Chism, Professor of INFO 523."
