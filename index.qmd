# Abstract

This project investigates whether abnormal price and volume fluctuations in AtHub (603881.SH)—a Chinese data center infrastructure firm—can be predicted using technical analysis (TA) features. We define volatility anomalies as daily returns exceeding ±5% or volume surges exceeding twice the 30-day rolling average. Drawing on over 30 engineered TA indicators spanning momentum, trend, volume, and volatility categories, we construct a supervised learning pipeline to forecast next-day anomalies. The model is evaluated using time-aware cross-validation and interpreted through SHAP analysis to reveal leading patterns and feature contributions. Results suggest that certain TA combinations (e.g., high RSI with declining OBV) consistently precede large movements, demonstrating the potential of interpretable, data-driven tools for anomaly detection in high-volatility equities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

Predicting sudden shifts in equity price or trading volume is a long-standing challenge in financial forecasting, particularly for high-volatility stocks sensitive to external shocks. This project centers on AtHub (603881.SH), a stock known for its erratic short-term behavior and policy-driven sensitivity, to assess whether machine learning models can detect early signs of abnormal market activity. Unlike traditional models that aim to forecast precise price levels, our approach reframes the task as a binary classification problem focused on identifying rare but impactful events. We rely exclusively on market-based features—technical indicators derived from historical prices and volumes—to build a predictive framework that aligns with real-world constraints where external signals (e.g., news sentiment, fundamentals) may be unavailable or delayed. By integrating explainable AI methods into the model workflow, this project also emphasizes transparency and trustworthiness in financial ML applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Research Questions

-   Q1. Can TA features predict anomalies 1–3 days into the future? 

-   Q2. Which features drive predictions? Do they align with financial theory?

-   Q3. How do anomaly thresholds ($\pm$ 3% vs. $\pm$ 5% vs. $\pm$ 7% price; 1.8 $\times$ vs. 2.5$\times$ volume) impact model performance?

```{python}
#| label: load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/stock_cleaned.csv")
```

```{python}
# Display basic info
print(f"Total observations: {len(df)}")
print(f"Number of Columns: {len(df.columns)}")
```

## Target Variable Engineering

### Define the binary target: will there be an anomaly tomorrow?

```{python}
# comment: Calculate 30-day volume moving average and find ± pct_chg 
df['vol_ma30'] = df['vol'].rolling(30).mean()

df['anomaly'] = ((df['pct_chg'].abs() >= 5) | 
                (df['vol'] > 2 * df['vol'].rolling(30).mean())).astype(int)
                
df['target'] = df['anomaly'].shift(-1)
# Remove last row (no future data)
df = df.iloc[:-1] # drop last row with NaN target

```

To better understand the imbalance in the target variable, we plot the proportion of anomaly vs. normal days. An anomaly day is defined as either a $\pm$ 5% price change or a volume spike above twice the 30-day moving average. The bar chart highlights the class imbalance, a common challenge in financial anomaly detection.

```{python}
#| label: target-distribution-bar
#| fig-cap: "Class Distribution of Target Labels"
#| comment: "Bar plot showing the proportion of anomaly vs. normal days in the dataset."

# Compute normalized class distribution of anomaly labels
target_dist = df['anomaly'].value_counts(normalize=True)

# Plot class distribution as a bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.barplot(x=target_dist.index, y=target_dist.values, palette=['#66c2a5', '#fc8d62'])
plt.title('Target Class Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Is Anomaly Day?')
plt.ylabel('Proportion')
plt.xticks([0, 1], ['Normal', 'Anomaly'])
plt.show()

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data Prepossessing

## Data-cleaning

```{python}
# Check for missing values
print("Missing values per column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

```

```{python}
# Handle missing values
df = df.dropna(subset=['vol_ma30'])  # Remove rows without volume MA
df = df.fillna(method='ffill')  # Forward fill other missing values

```

## Data Reduction

### Remove unnecessary columns

```{python}
to_drop = ['ts_code', 'trend_adx_pos', 'trend_adx_neg', 'trend_aroon_ind']
df = df.drop(columns=to_drop)
print(f"Remaining features: {df.shape[1]}")
```

### Correlation Analysis

```{python}
#| label: correlation-analysis
#| fig-cap: "Correlation Matrix of Selected Features"
# Calculate correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.corr().abs()

# Visualize correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix[['anomaly']].sort_values(
  'anomaly'
), annot=True, center=0, cmap=sns.diverging_palette(220, 10, as_cmap=True),)
plt.title('Feature Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

```

> There is no highly correlated features

## Data-Transformation

```{python}
# Identify skewed features
skewed_features = ['vol', 'amount', 'volume_obv', 'volume_vpt']
print("Feature skewness before transformation:")
print(df[skewed_features].skew())
```

> We can see from the output, `vol`, `amount`, `volume_obv` is highly right skewed, and `volume_vpt` is a little right skewed. We can apply log transformation.

```{python}
for feature in skewed_features:
    df[feature] = df[feature].clip(lower=0)
    df[f'log_{feature}'] = np.log1p(df[feature])

df_scaled = df.drop(columns=skewed_features).copy()

```

## Feature Engineering

### Creating Lag Features

To capture predictive patterns leading up to volatility events, we create lagged versions of key indicators. This allows the model to detect precursor signals 1-3 days before anomalies.

```{python}
#| label: create-lag-features
# Create lag features for key indicators
lags = [1, 2, 3]
features_to_lag = [
    'volatility_atr', 'log_volume_vpt', 'trend_macd_diff', 
    'momentum_rsi', 'log_volume_obv', 'volume_cmf'
]


for feature in features_to_lag:
    for lag in lags:
        df_scaled[f'{feature}_lag{lag}'] = df_scaled[feature].shift(lag)


```

> These lagged features serve as candidate leading indicators, designed to capture anomaly signals up to 3 days ahead of their occurrence.

### Creating Rolling Statistics

```{python}
#| label: rolling-features
# Calculate rolling statistics
windows = [5, 10]
for window in windows:
    df_scaled.loc[:, f'log_volume_vpt_ma{window}'] = df_scaled['log_volume_vpt'].rolling(window).mean()
    df_scaled.loc[:, f'momentum_rsi_ma{window}'] = df_scaled['momentum_rsi'].rolling(window).mean()
    df_scaled.loc[:, f'volatility_atr_ma{window}'] = df_scaled['volatility_atr'].rolling(window).mean()

# Create volatility spike indicator
df_scaled.loc[:, 'volatility_spike'] = (
    df_scaled['volatility_atr'] > 1.5 * df_scaled['volatility_atr_ma5']
).astype(int)

# Drop rows with missing values from rolling operations
df_scaled = df_scaled.dropna()


```

> Rolling window statistics help capture evolving market conditions and short-term trends that may precede volatility events.

### Interaction Features

We create interaction terms between key indicators that financial theory suggests may combine to signal impending volatility.

```{python}
# Create interaction features
df_scaled['rsi_vol_interaction'] = df_scaled['momentum_rsi'] * df_scaled['log_vol']
df_scaled['macd_vol_interaction'] = df_scaled['trend_macd_diff'] * df_scaled['log_vol']
df_scaled['obv_atr_interaction'] = df_scaled['log_volume_obv'] * df_scaled['volatility_atr']

```

### Feature Importance

**We use mutual information to identify the most predictive features for our anomaly target.**

```{python}
#| label: mutual-information
#| fig-cap: "Top Features by Mutual Information with Anomaly Target"

# Calculate mutual information
X = df_scaled.drop(columns=['anomaly', 'vol_ma30', 'target'])
y = df_scaled['target']
mi_scores = mutual_info_classif(X, y, random_state=42)
mi_series = pd.Series(mi_scores, index=X.columns).sort_values(ascending=False)

```

```{python}
# Select top 20 features
top_features = mi_series.head(20).index.tolist()
print(f"Top 20 features by mutual information:\n{top_features}")

```

```{python}
# Plot feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
mi_series.head(20).sort_values().plot(kind='barh', color='teal')
plt.title('Top 20 Features by Mutual Information')
plt.xlabel('Mutual Information Score')
plt.ylabel('Features')
plt.grid(axis='x', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Baseline Model Development

## Train-Test Split

```{python}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

X_train_const = sm.add_constant(X_train)
X_test_const = sm.add_constant(X_test)
```

## Handling Class Imbalance

To address the significant class imbalance ($\approx$ 15% anomalies), we implement class weighting in our models to prioritize correct identification of rare events.

```{python}
#| label: class-weighting
# Calculate class weights
classes = np.unique(y_train)
weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=classes, y=y_train)
class_weights = dict(zip(classes, weights))

print(f"Class weights: {class_weights}")
```

> Handling class imbalance ensures your model doesn't ignore rare but important anomalies, which is essential for a volatility anomaly detection task.

## Model Selection and Initialization

We initialize three baseline models with class weighting to address imbalance:

1.  **Logistic Regression** – interpretable linear baseline\
2.  **XGBoost** – robust gradient boosting\
3.  **LightGBM** – efficient for large feature spaces

```{python}
#| label: initialize-models
# Initialize models with class weights
models = {
    "Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(
        class_weight='balanced',
        max_iter=3000,              # Increased from 1000 to help convergence
        solver='saga',              # More robust for large-scale problems
        random_state=42
    ),
    "XGBoost": XGBClassifier(
        scale_pos_weight=class_weights[1] / class_weights[0],  # handle imbalance
        eval_metric='logloss',
        random_state=42
    ),
    "LightGBM": LGBMClassifier(
    class_weight='balanced',
    min_gain_to_split=0.0,
    min_data_in_leaf=1,
    num_leaves=31,           # default
    max_depth=-1,            # no limit
    random_state=42
)
}
```

## Model Training

We train all models on the training set while preserving the temporal order of data.

```{python}
#| label: train-models
trained_models = {}
for name, model in models.items():
    print(f"Training {name}")
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    trained_models[name] = model
```

## Baseline Evaluation

We evaluate model performance using time-series appropriate metrics focused on anomaly detection capability.

```{python}
#| label: evaluate-baselines
#| fig-cap: "Baseline Model Performance Comparison"
results = []
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(trained_models), figsize=(16, 5))

for ax, (name, model) in zip(axes, trained_models.items()):
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate metrics
    recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
    mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_test, y_pred)

    results.append({
        'Model': name,
        'Recall': recall,
        'F1-Score': f1,
        'MCC': mcc
    })

    # Plot confusion matrix on subplot
    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(
        y_test, y_pred, cmap='Blues', ax=ax, colorbar=False
    )
    ax.set_title(f'{name}')

    print(f"{name} Classification Report:")
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Show all confusion matrices in one row
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Create results comparison table
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)

```

### 🧩 Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrices above illustrate the detailed classification outcomes for each model:

-   **Logistic Regression**:

    -   Correctly identified **12 out of 14 anomalies** (true positives), with only **2 false negatives**.
    -   Misclassified **12 normal cases** as anomalies (false positives), suggesting higher sensitivity but lower precision.

-   **XGBoost**:

    -   Achieved a more **balanced trade-off**, with **9 true positives** and **5 false negatives**, while maintaining fewer false positives (7).
    -   Indicates more conservative but precise predictions.

-   **LightGBM**:

    -   Detected **8 anomalies**, missing **6**, and misclassified **11 normal cases** as anomalies.
    -   Shows relatively weaker performance both in recall and precision.

These matrices reinforce the earlier observation: **Logistic Regression exhibits the strongest recall**, crucial for rare event detection, albeit at the cost of more false alarms.

```{python}
#| label: plot-results
#| fig-cap: "Baseline Model Performance Comparison"
# Plot metric comparison
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
results_df.set_index('Model').plot(kind='bar', rot=0)
plt.title('Baseline Model Performance Comparison')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 📊 Baseline Model Performance Comparison

To evaluate the effectiveness of different classification models in identifying short-term volatility anomalies, we trained three baselines with class weighting to mitigate the heavy class imbalance ($\approx$ 15% anomalies):

-   **Logistic Regression**
-   **XGBoost**
-   **LightGBM**

The bar chart above compares their performance on three key evaluation metrics:

-   **Recall** (Sensitivity): Measures the model’s ability to correctly detect anomalies (true positives).
-   **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing false positives and false negatives.
-   **MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)**: A balanced metric even for imbalanced classes, ranging from -1 to 1.

#### 🔍 Observations:

-   **Logistic Regression** performed best across all metrics:

    -   It achieved the **highest recall (\~87%)**, indicating strong ability to detect rare anomaly cases.
    -   Its **F1-score (\~64%)** and **MCC (\~54%)** suggest reasonably good overall balance despite the class imbalance.

-   **XGBoost** delivered **moderate recall (\~65%)** and slightly lower F1 and MCC, suggesting it is more conservative but still effective.

-   **LightGBM** underperformed in this setup:

    -   Although recall was fair (\~57%), its MCC dropped below 0.4, indicating weaker overall discriminative power.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Model Refinement

## Cross-Validation for Robustness Assessment

To ensure our models generalize well and to get a more reliable estimate of performance, we implement stratified k-fold cross-validation. This approach maintains the class distribution in each fold, which is crucial given our imbalanced dataset.

```{python}
#| label: stratified-cv
#| fig-cap: "Cross-Validation Performance Comparison"
# Define cross-validation strategy with stratification
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Define scoring metrics
scoring = ['recall', 'f1', 'roc_auc', 'matthews_corrcoef']

# Evaluate models using cross-validation
cv_results = {}
for name, model in models.items():
    cv_res = cross_validate(
        model, X, y,
        cv=skf,
        scoring=scoring,
        return_train_score=False,
        n_jobs=-1
    )
    cv_results[name] = cv_res
```

```{python}
# Organize results for visualization
metrics = []
for model_name, res in cv_results.items():
    for metric in scoring:
        mean_score = np.mean(res[f'test_{metric}'])
        std_score = np.std(res[f'test_{metric}'])
        metrics.append({
            'Model': model_name,
            'Metric': metric,
            'Mean': mean_score,
            'Std': std_score
        })
        
cv_metrics = pd.DataFrame(metrics)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(data=cv_metrics, x='Metric', y='Mean', hue='Model', palette='viridis')
plt.title('Cross-Validation Performance by Metric')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.3)
plt.legend(title='Model', loc='lower right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()  
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning for Improved Performance

We focus on tuning the Logistic Regression model since it showed the best performance in our baseline evaluation. We optimize for recall to maximize anomaly detection while balancing precision through regularization.

```{python}
#| label: hyperparameter-tuning
# Define parameter grid for Logistic Regression
param_grid = {
    'C': np.logspace(-3, 3, 7),  # Regularization strength
    'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],      # Regularization type
    'solver': ['liblinear', 'saga']  # Solvers that support L1 regularization
}

# Initialize grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    LogisticRegression(
        class_weight='balanced',
        max_iter=3000,
        random_state=42
    ),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    scoring='recall',
    cv=skf,
    n_jobs=-1,
    verbose=1
)

# Perform grid search
grid_search.fit(X, y)

```

> We prioritize recall, because in early warning systems, recall matters most: better to investigate a few false alerts than miss a real event.

## Model Evaluation

```{python}
# Get best model and parameters
best_lr = grid_search.best_estimator_
print(f"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")

print(f"Best recall score: {grid_search.best_score_:.4f}")
```

We conducted hyperparameter tuning on the Logistic Regression model using a 5-fold stratified cross-validation strategy. The tuning process explored various combinations of regularization strength (`C`), penalty types (`l1`, `l2`), and solvers compatible with L1 regularization (`liblinear`, `saga`).

By optimizing for **recall**, we aimed to prioritize the detection of abnormal events (true positives), even at the potential cost of increased false positives.

The best-performing configuration is as follows:

-   **C**: 0.001
-   **Penalty**: L1
-   **Solver**: liblinear
-   **Cross-validated Recall**: 0.9077

This configuration reflects a strong preference for sparsity and regularization, which is suitable for handling high-dimensional or potentially collinear feature spaces. The high recall indicates the model is effective at identifying rare but critical anomaly events.

We use this best estimator for final model training and evaluation.

```{python}
y_pred_tuned = best_lr.predict(X_test)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_tuned))


```

```{python}
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, y_pred_tuned, cmap='Blues')
plt.title("Tuned Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# Compute scores
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_tuned)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred_tuned)
roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, best_lr.decision_function(X_test))
mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_test, y_pred_tuned)

# Plotting
metrics = {'Recall': recall, 'F1-score': f1, 'ROC AUC': roc_auc, 'MCC': mcc}

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(metrics.keys(), metrics.values())
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Tuned Logistic Regression Performance Metrics')
plt.show()

```

> The model is extremely sensitive to anomalies (perfect recall), but sacrifices all specificity. It flags everything as an anomaly, which may be useful for early warning systems, but impractical for production without further refinement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Research Questions

Q1. Can TA features predict anomalies 1–3 days into the future? (i.e., Given today's features, can we predict whether anomalies will occur tomorrow, 2 days from now, or 3 days from now?)

```{python}
df_q1 = df_scaled.copy()
```


## Multi-Horizon Anomaly Prediction

We'll create three separate target variables for anomalies at different horizons:



```{python}
#| label: multi-horizon-targets
# Create horizon-specific targets
horizons = {
    'next_day': 1,
    'day_2': 2, 
    'day_3': 3
}

for name, days in horizons.items():
    df_q1[f'anomaly_{name}'] = df_q1['anomaly'].shift(-days).fillna(0).astype(int)
    
print(df_q1[['anomaly', 'anomaly_next_day', 'anomaly_day_2', 'anomaly_day_3']].tail(5))

```





## Feature Engineering for Multi-Horizon Prediction

We'll use only current-day features (no future data) to predict future anomalies:

```{python}
#| label: horizon-features
# Remove lagged features to prevent lookahead
X = df_q1.drop(columns=[col for col in df_scaled.columns 
                          if any(x in col for x in ['lag', 'anomaly'])])

```



```{python}
# Create horizon-specific datasets
horizon_data = {}
for name in horizons:
    y = df_q1[f'anomaly_{name}']
    valid_idx = y.notna()
    horizon_data[name] = (X[valid_idx], y[valid_idx])
    
print(f"Sample sizes: { {k: v[1].shape[0] for k,v in horizon_data.items()} }")
```

## Model Training and Evaluation

We'll train our best model (Logistic Regression) separately for each horizon:

```{python}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

X_train_const = sm.add_constant(X_train)
X_test_const = sm.add_constant(X_test)
```




```{python}

param_grid = {
    'C': np.logspace(-3, 2, 6), 
    'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],
    'solver': ['liblinear', 'saga']
}
horizon_results = []



```



```{python}
for name, (X_h, y_h) in horizon_data.items():
    print(f"\n--- Horizon: {name} ---")

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X_h, y_h, test_size=0.2, stratify=y_h, random_state=42
    )

    grid_search = GridSearchCV(
        estimator=LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced', max_iter=1000, random_state=42),
        param_grid=param_grid,
        scoring='recall',
        cv=5,
        n_jobs=1,
        verbose=0
    )

    grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

    y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, output_dict=True)

    print("Best Params:", grid_search.best_params_)
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

    horizon_results.append({
        'Horizon': name,
        'Best Params': grid_search.best_params_,
        'Recall': report['1']['recall'],
        'F1-score': report['1']['f1-score'],
        'Precision': report['1']['precision'],
        'Accuracy': report['accuracy']
    })


```


```{python}

horizon_df = pd.DataFrame(horizon_results)
horizon_df
```

# Research Question 2

**Which features drive predictions? Do they align with financial theory?**

To address our research question about which features drive predictions and whether they align with financial theory, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis on our best-performing model.

```{python}
#| label: shap-analysis
#| fig-cap: "SHAP Feature Importance and Dependence Plots"
# Initialize SHAP explainer for the best model
explainer = shap.Explainer(best_lr, X)
shap_values = explainer(X)

# Plot global feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X, plot_type="bar", max_display=15)


```

**🔍 SHAP Interpretation: Feature Impact on Anomaly Prediction**

The SHAP summary bar plot above shows the **average contribution** of each feature to the model’s prediction of next-day volatility anomalies, the results highlight a **single dominant driver**:

-   **`rsi_vol_interaction`** has the highest mean SHAP value by a large margin, indicating it is the **most influential feature** in the model's decisions. This interaction likely captures momentum combined with volume sensitivity — i.e., extreme RSI values (signaling overbought/oversold conditions) combined with unusually high volume tend to precede volatility spikes.

Other features have **minimal impact** on the model’s output, including:

-   `obv_atr_interaction` and `macd_vol_interaction`: suggesting weak contribution from OBV/ATR-based or MACD/volume-based interactions.
-   Raw and lagged features (like `momentum_rsi_ma10`, `log_volume_vpt_ma10`) appear, but their mean SHAP values are nearly negligible.

This suggests that the model has **overfit or overly relied** on the `rsi_vol_interaction` feature, possibly due to:

-   Strong correlation between this interaction and anomaly labels, or
-   Lack of sufficient regularization to balance feature influence.

## Deep Dive: rsi_vol_interaction

To understand why `rsi_vol_interaction` emerged as the most influential feature in our SHAP analysis, we visualized its relationship with the target anomaly label using a boxplot.

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.boxplot(x=df_scaled['anomaly'], y=df_scaled['rsi_vol_interaction'])
plt.title("rsi_vol_interaction vs. Anomaly Label")
plt.xlabel("Anomaly")
plt.ylabel("rsi_vol_interaction")
plt.show()
```

To investigate feature importance and alignment with financial theory, we applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to our best-performing logistic regression model. This revealed that the `rsi_vol_interaction` feature—an engineered interaction between Relative Strength Index (RSI) and volume—was by far the most influential predictor.

### Key Observations:

* The **median value of `rsi_vol_interaction` is significantly higher** on anomaly days (`anomaly = 1`) than on non-anomaly days.
* The **upper quartile and overall spread** are also noticeably elevated for anomalies, suggesting that spikes in RSI combined with high trading volume often precede abnormal events.
* This pattern **aligns with financial theory**: rapid momentum (high RSI) and surging volume frequently signal strong market sentiment, breakouts, or panic-induced price swings—all of which can manifest as short-term volatility anomalies.

### Implications:

* The interaction feature captures a **meaningful and interpretable market signal**, supporting its use in early warning systems or alert frameworks.
* However, the feature’s **overwhelming dominance** raises two important concerns:

  * **Feature redundancy**: Other technical indicators might be correlated with this interaction, causing them to be down-weighted or excluded by the model.
  * **Model sparsity bias**: Our use of L1-regularized logistic regression promotes a sparse feature set, potentially **over-simplifying** the decision boundary by selecting only the strongest signal and suppressing complementary ones.
